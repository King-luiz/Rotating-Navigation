# Rotating Navigation

## Overview
This project features a **rotating navigation menu** implemented with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It demonstrates how to create an engaging UI effect using animations and transformations. The navigation rotates the page when toggled, revealing a menu with smooth transitions.

## Features
- **Rotating Navigation Effect**: A unique UI interaction that rotates the page when the menu is opened.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes and adapts well.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Used for better aesthetics and user experience.
- **Engaging Content**: Includes an article about **dogs as pets**, making the page informative and visually appealing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and layout design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Handling navigation interactions.
- **Font Awesome**: Adding modern and appealing icons.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/King-luiz/rotating-navigation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd rotating-navigation
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Project Structure
```
rotating-navigation/
â”‚â”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML file
â”‚â”€â”€ style.css       # Styling file for layout and effects
â”‚â”€â”€ script.js       # JavaScript file handling menu interactions
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md       # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

2. Clicking the **close button** (`Ã—`) rotates it back to the original view.
3. Navigation includes **Home, About, and Contact** options.



## Future Improvements
